Free tool to track epee fencing

You will need two wireless mice and some mad skills to make wireless touch detectors.
Right click - one swordsman, Left click - another.
40 ms timeout for simultaneous touch.
1400 ms after touch before start of next round

No measures against floor/ceiling/guard touch. 
Hopefully **yet**, but currently I do not see how to implement it easily.
